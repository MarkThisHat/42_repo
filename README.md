# 42_repo
I decided to rename my first ever created repository and use it to put my projects from 42 school.

Many ways are available to learn computer engineering, but I feel that studying here is somehow special. It's just another path towards the same goal, but being here makes the journey so much better.

I have never been to a place with this kind of community. Truly, one of the many things that got me into computer programming was how people were able to collaborate and help each other, but in here there is this sense of belonging that I never felt anywhere else.
